Simple game that is similar to space invaders.
You have to destroy all enemy ships. You control your ship with "a" and "d" keys (moving left and right), shoot with "s" key and exit game with "q" key. You can only shoot if your previous bullet missed (left the game map) or destroyed enemy ship (it means there can be only 1 bullet on the screen).

.SH BUGS
.TP 
When control keys are pressed for too long, weird things may happen: some objects can be written on the screen even though they are not supposed to be there (it is probably fault of the way that rendering objets work in this game)
.TP
If player destroys all of the enemy ships (which is hard ;)) then he needs to wait for a bit before the winning information shows (it is because of laziness of the author)
